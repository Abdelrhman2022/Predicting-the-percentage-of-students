# Predicting-the-percentage-of-students

In this Notebook I'll implement regression model using Scikit-Learn library. I'll start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

# Simple Linear Regression

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

# Evaluating the model
- Evaluate the performance of algorithm. This step is particularly important to compare how well different algorithms perform on a particular dataset. For simplicity here, we have chosen the mean square error. There are many such metrics: 

  - Mean Absolute Error: **3.92**
  - Mean squared error: **18.94**
  - Coefficient of determination: **0.97**
